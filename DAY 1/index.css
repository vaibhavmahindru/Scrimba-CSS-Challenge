/* 
 Your main goal is to style and improve the HTML given to you.
 You have to center all the text on the page & set the font to Roboto,
 capitalize all the titles, give the main title a font size of 4em and the section titles a size of 3em, 
 and give all the sections an overall margin of 10% of the height of the page. 
 The section titles must have a color of #3278cf, while the main title must have a color of #174885. 
 Good luck!
